## Description
This is the YouTube tutorial I followed for making a simple number-matching game in Unity:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQm_pSmGRw

In the tutorial, they used words to indicate if a response was right or wrong, which is not a very accessible approach for the target audience of a game like this (4-5-year-olds) who may not be able to read yet and are just starting to learn numbers and simple pattern matching.

In response to this, I extended the example to include: audio feedback that plays for correct ("tada") and incorrect ("womp womp womp") responses and more visual feedback that does not rely on words such as positive and negative emojis, and an arrow graphic instead of a "next" button.

In this repository, you will find a folder containing the Unity project and assets (built in Unity v. 2021.3.13f1), another folder with a Windows EXE build, as well as a WebGL build that runs in the web browser (labeled "docs" for working with GitHub Pages).
