# Number Game -- Programming Test

I followed this YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmQm_pSmGRw) for making a simple number matching game in Unity.

In the tutorial, they use words to indicate if a response was right or wrong, but that is not necessarily the most accessible approach for a young audience (4-5 year olds) who this game would be targeted towards.

I extended the example to include audio feedback that plays for correct ("tada") and incorrect ("womp womp womp") responses, and more visual feedback that does not rely on words such as positive and negative emojies, and an arrow graphic instead of a "next" button.

In this repository you will find a folder containing the Unity project and assets (built in Unity v. 2021.3.13f1), another folder with a Windows EXE build, as well as a WebGL build that runs in the web browser.
